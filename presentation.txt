talk about what the prototype is - connects the kinect and the stepper motor
	Ella - introduce what the prototype is
	Red - talk about Arduino and the stepper
	Ella - talk about the C program and Python script to send commands

Problems we ran into while building the prototype
	Red - Stepper motor driver - doesn't actually have Arduino libraries so we had to figure out things from the datasheet
	Ella - Building the example program needed some old libraries

Project relevance - connects the Kinect and stepper motor
