talk about what the prototype is - connects the kinect and the stepper motor
	Red - talk about Arduino and the stepper
	Ella - talk about the C program and Python script to send commands

Problems we ran into while building the prototype
	Red - Stepper motor driver - doesn't actually have Arduino libraries
	Ella - Building the example program needed some old libraries
